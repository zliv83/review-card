## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

### Built with

- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned that even thought composition is usually the way to go... context can be a real help when your component is the sum of a good amount of other components.

### Continued development

I'll be working more on css layout.
